      <guid>/blog/class_projects/sls/slsdesign/</guid>
      <description>We designed a spinning top that is novel, aesthetically pleasing, durable, spins well, and whose unique fan assembly can only be made using SLS. Our design incorporates a modular top system that allows for interchangeable designs to be attached to the universal base. We designed two UT-themed attachable tops, one that is a replica of the UT model tower and the other that is a replica of the UT seal.</description>

      <description>We investigated how different Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques could be used to perform sentiment analysis on real user generated text data from the Sentiment140 dataset [1]. First we investigated an LSTM model before deciding on using the self-attention network code from [2] because of the possible speed and accuracy advantages. Our contributions included investigating how the training batch size and dropout rate affected the accuracy of the model and validating an existing model by reproducing it and using it with a different dataset.</description>

      <description>I extended the work of (Wu and Plantinga 2003) using R and certain equation modififications to investigate how the addition of a light rail line would influence a city.
Cities have housed most of the human race since 2004 and as a result influence most of the individual, commercial, and industrial energy and GHG patterns. However, city designs, have placed amenities in isolated suburban pockets, the abundance of roads have encouraged sprawl, and zoning laws have discouraged density.</description>

      <description>I compiled the land use of Austin by zoning and land use data. Furthermore, number of parking spaces and the square footage of those parking spaces by land use (single family homes, apartments and commercial buildings). Furthermore, I compared that square footage with the square footage actually in the buildings and the land area of the city of Austin. And then I used the building data I compiled to determine how much rooftop space Austin has and how much solar that could hold.</description>
