      <description>This post explores how to use Gurobi to solve LPs and MIPs. I have written these using Gurobi as a solver and as the mathematical formulation software. This is a reproducible example if you have R Studio just make sure you have installed the correct packages.

      <description>BackgroundThis post explores how to markov chains work and how to visulaize them in R. I use a R package specifically designed to visualize markov chains. I also represent these markov chains using tables. This is a reproducible example if you have R Studio just make sure you have installed the correct packages.
