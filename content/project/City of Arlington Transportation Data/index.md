This project presents a comprehensive data analytics approach applied to Arlington City's transportation data to gain insights and improve transportation infrastructure and services.
Through data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, the project identifies traffic hotspots, peak congestion times, and transit deserts within the city. Predictive modeling techniques are employed to forecast future traffic patterns and optimize transit routes. Additionally, the project evaluates the impact of demographic factors on transportation preferences and accessibility.

The findings of this project provide actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and transportation authorities to optimize resource allocation, enhance infrastructure planning, and improve overall transportation efficiency in Arlington City. By harnessing the power of data analytics, this study contributes to the development of data-driven strategies for sustainable and equitable urban transportation systems
