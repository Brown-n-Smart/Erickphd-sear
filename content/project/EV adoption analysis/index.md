This project focuses on analyzing single-family households with detached single-family homes to identify electric vehicle (EV) charge station locations and estimate the potential displacement of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) from internal combustion engine (ICE) cars to EVs. By examining socio-economic factors, including income levels and housing types, the study aims to identify households more likely to adopt EVs and upgrade electrical panels for EV charging. Through data analysis and modeling, the project will pinpoint areas where EV adoption is likely to be higher and quantify the potential electrification of VMT.
