  We investigate key questions regarding emerging trends and technologies such as:
  - The interplays between the macro and systems level
  - How the Internet of Things (IoT) and new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can help create more accurate digital models
  - How to use those models to control physical systems with tools like digital twins. 

  We typically use a multi-systems optimization modeling approach, but have used other methods like regression, machine learning, systems dynamics, and agent-based modeling simulation techniques.

  We are currently building our lab so that we can: 
  1) Run large-scale experiments on distributed systems (e.g., solar and RWH), smart buildings, net-zero homes, autonomous transportation, and electric vehicle charging. 
  2) Have servers that can run computationally expensive optimization and simulation models, perform data analytics, monitor and control connected devices, and store large amounts of data; 
  3) Have IoT and ICT devices like RFID and smart meters to generate data and monitor research activities; 
  4) Have production, inventory control, supply chain, and logistics equipment such as 3D printers and a conveyor system.
